1. create service.ts in a seprate folder.
2. create a user service array in service.ts file and fetch this file record in app.component.ts file
3. Injecting user-service in the app.component (in constructor) so app component and it's child component can easily access the service data.
4. provide this service inside component directive
  - providers:[UserService] (on;y in parent component)
5. call service from any component where you want to use it and that's it.

** Injecting service into another service **

1- create a new service file called (logger.service.ts)
2- In user service.ts (Receiver service file)
    - create an instance is logger service inside the user service
        - constructor(private logger: LoggerService){}
    - use @Injectable to inject something from logger service to user service
        - @Injectable
    - for providing this service to a component (app.component.ts)
        - constructor(private userService : UserService, private logger : LoggerService){}
